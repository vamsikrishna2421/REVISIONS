NOTES FOR DOCKER SWARM

To init docker swarm in master node
#docker swarm init --advertising-addr 192.168.0.18
copy the join token from output.

to add worker nodes to master node.
#docker swarm join --token <tokenSHA> 192.168.0.18:2377

NOw to check all the nodes in swarm cluster
#docker node ls

TASK:create a service and remove it.
#docker service --help
#docker service create --name=service1 ubuntu:latest
#docker service rm service1
#docker service ls

#docker service create --name=service2 nginx
#docker service ls
#docker ps //shows containers on that particular node only
#docker service ps service1 //shows on which node it is running
#docker service ps service2 


#UPDATE
increase replications of a service
#docker service update service1 --replicas=4

Lookat networks
#docker network ls
We will have new docker_gwbridge(bridge) and ingress(overlay) networks.

We can create a new network also
#docker network create --driver overlay mynetwork1
#docker network create --driver overlay mynetwork2

#docker network ls
See new netwoks with scope as swarm.


Lets delete a node and see what happens
#docker stop service1.1
Now automatically a new container is bought up.



#SCALING
#docker service scale service1=10
#docker service scale service2=5

#docker service ls
#docker service scale service1=1 service2=2


#STACK
#docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yaml voteapp

#docker service ls

If u need to change no.of replicas.
Edit the stack file

#docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml voteapp
Now it updates.

#docker ps //shows containers only in manager node.

#docker service ls
Now u have desired no. of replicas

Check individual microservice containers location.
#docker service ps <service-id>

8080 port is used for visualizer to see what services are running in gui.

Promote worker node to leader.
#docker node promote node2 
#docker node promote node3
#docker node ls
U will see unreachable manager status
All these leader nodes use raft consensus in swarm mode.

Demote back to worker node
#docker node demote node2
#docker node demote node3

To see stacks
#docker stack ls

remove a stack
#docker stack rm voteapp

to remove services
#docker service rm service1 service2

//on that node
To remove a node from swarm cluster
#docker swarm leave 


For databases we use database glusterFS
We cannot use database with out shared file system
or all servers are connected to single physical server.
